I created a LabVIEW program that can analyze the data coming from 
serial ports. the program can work with 20 different data or less, the data coming from the serial port should be as a package, the separator between data can be chosen by the user.

Analyzed data will be displayed in a table and at the same time, it will be saved to the computer as a txt file.

Incoming data will be graphed and the graphs of the data selected by the user will be compared with each other.

I used LabVIEW 2018.
